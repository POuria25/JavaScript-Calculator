![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/577ada3f-d5d9-46ae-9f3f-1ff33204b8a1)

A simple and user-friendly JavaScript-based calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This calculator supports basic arithmetic operations, keyboard input, and even expression preprocessing (e.g., `4Â²` becomes `16` automatically).

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Responsive UI** â€“ Clean and modern interface designed with HTML and CSS.
- **Basic Operations** â€“ Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Advanced Functions:**
  - Square (`Â²`)
  - Square root (`âˆš`)
  - Power (`^`)
  - Modulo (`%`)
  - Factorial (`!`)
  - Fibonacci sequence calculation
- **Symbol Preprocessing** â€“ Converts special symbols like `Â²` or `âˆš` into valid expressions.
- **Keyboard Support** â€“ Fully functional through keyboard input for fast and efficient usage.
- **Real-Time Display** â€“ See expressions and results update as you type.

## ðŸš€ How It Works

### User Interface

The calculator has a grid layout with buttons for numbers, operators, and functions. Inputs are displayed in a screen-like area, showing both the current expression and the evaluated result.

### Input Handling

Button clicks and key presses are captured using event listeners. Each symbol or number is appended to the expression string.

### Expression Evaluation

Before evaluation, special characters like `Â²`, `âˆš`, or `!` are parsed and replaced with JavaScript-compatible syntax. For example:

- `Â²` â†’ `Math.pow(x, 2)`
- `âˆš` â†’ `Math.sqrt(x)`
- `!` â†’ Custom recursive factorial function
- `Fibonacci(n)` â†’ Uses a recursive or iterative function to compute the nth Fibonacci number

### Error Handling

The calculator includes simple try-catch blocks to gracefully handle invalid expressions or division by zero.

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- **HTML5** â€“ For layout and structure.
- **CSS3** â€“ For styling, layout, and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript (ES6)** â€“ Core logic, event handling, expression parsing, and evaluation.
